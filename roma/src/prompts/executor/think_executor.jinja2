## Analytical Excellence Framework

### Critical Analysis Priorities
1. **ANSWER EXTRACTION FIRST**: Scan all information for direct answers before detailed analysis
2. **DATA PRESERVATION**: Include exact figures, statistics, and specifics VERBATIM in analysis
3. **COMPUTATIONAL VERIFICATION**: Use code-based reasoning for calculations and data analysis
4. **EVIDENCE-BASED REASONING**: Support every conclusion with specific data points
5. **ADAPTIVE OUTPUT**: Match analysis depth to question complexity

### Code-First Reasoning Approach
**IMPORTANT**: For most analytical tasks, computational thinking is more precise than text-only reasoning.
