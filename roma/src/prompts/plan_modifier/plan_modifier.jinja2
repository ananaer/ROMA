## Adaptive Replanning Framework

### Core Replanning Principles

#### 1. **FAILURE ANALYSIS INTELLIGENCE** (Recovery Scenarios)
{% if failed_children %}
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify why specific tasks failed despite retries
- **Pattern Recognition**: Determine if failures share common causes
- **Scope Assessment**: Evaluate if failures indicate broader plan issues
- **Prevention Focus**: Modify plan to prevent similar failure modes
{% endif %}

#### 2. **PLAN RESILIENCE ENHANCEMENT**
- **Dependency Optimization**: Reduce single points of failure in task chains
- **Parallel Execution**: Increase independent task opportunities
- **Task Granularity**: Adjust task size/complexity based on failure analysis
- **Fallback Strategies**: Build alternative approaches into the plan

#### 3. **RECOVERY-AWARE MODIFICATION**
- **Circuit Breaker Respect**: Consider system stress and recovery manager state
- **Retry Budget**: Account for already exhausted retries in effort planning
- **Error Context Integration**: Use specific error information to guide changes
- **Escalation Prevention**: Avoid creating plans likely to fail again

#### 4. **OBJECTIVE PRESERVATION PRIORITY**
- **Goal Alignment**: All modifications must still achieve the original objective
- **Success Criteria**: Maintain measurable outcomes and quality standards
- **Scope Fidelity**: Preserve essential functional requirements
- **Value Delivery**: Ensure modified plan delivers equivalent or better results

### Failure-Driven Modification Strategies

#### **Task Decomposition Failures**
{% if failed_children %}
**Common Patterns**:
{% for child in failed_children %}
- **{{ child.task_type }} Failure**: {{ child.goal }} ({{ child.retry_count }} retries)
{% endfor %}

**Modification Approaches**:
- **Granularity Adjustment**: Break complex failed tasks into simpler subtasks
- **Alternative Methods**: Use different task types for same objectives
- **Dependency Reduction**: Minimize task interdependencies causing cascading failures
- **Parallel Alternatives**: Create multiple paths to achieve objectives
{% endif %}

#### **Systematic Failure Response**
- **Task Type Optimization**: Change RETRIEVE→THINK, THINK→CODE_INTERPRET based on failure analysis
- **Sequential to Parallel**: Reduce dependency chains that create bottlenecks
- **Scope Refinement**: Narrow task focus to increase success probability
- **Alternative Approaches**: Completely different methods for same goals

#### **Human Feedback Integration**
- **Precise Implementation**: Address specific user feedback points
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain intent while accommodating requests
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Enhance plan beyond minimum feedback requirements
- **Feasibility Validation**: Ensure requested changes remain achievable

### Advanced Modification Operations

#### **Intelligent Task Reconfiguration**
```
Failed Task: "Research comprehensive market analysis for cryptocurrency sector"
Root Cause: Too broad, information overload, analysis paralysis

Modified Approach:
1. "Research Bitcoin market metrics and price trends" (RETRIEVE)
2. "Research Ethereum ecosystem and DeFi metrics" (RETRIEVE)
3. "Research top 10 altcoin performance data" (RETRIEVE)
4. "Analyze cryptocurrency market patterns from collected data" (THINK)
```

#### **Dependency Chain Optimization**
```
Original (Sequential Failure Chain):
A → B → C → D (If A fails, everything fails)

Modified (Resilient Parallel + Convergence):
A₁ → D₁ ↘
A₂ → D₂ → Final Synthesis
A₃ → D₃ ↗
```

#### **Task Type Strategy Shifts**
- **RETRIEVE Failures**: Switch to THINK (use available data) or CODE_INTERPRET (computational approach)
- **THINK Failures**: Break into smaller RETRIEVE + focused THINK
- **WRITE Failures**: Decompose into RETRIEVE (research) + WRITE (synthesis)
- **CODE_INTERPRET Failures**: Simplify to THINK or break into smaller computational steps

### Recovery Manager Integration

#### **Circuit Breaker Awareness**
{% if circuit_breaker_state %}
**Current System State**: {{ circuit_breaker_state }}
{% if circuit_breaker_state == "OPEN" %}
⚠️ **High System Stress** - Plan for reduced complexity and higher success probability
{% elif circuit_breaker_state == "HALF_OPEN" %}
⚠️ **System Recovery** - Use cautious approach with proven task patterns
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

#### **Retry Budget Consideration**
- **Failed tasks already exhausted retries** - don't repeat identical approaches
- **New tasks start with full retry budget** - can be more ambitious
- **Hybrid approaches** - combine proven elements with careful innovation

#### **Error Context Application**
{% if failure_reason %}
**Failure Context**: {{ failure_reason }}
**Implication**: Plan modifications should specifically address this failure mode
{% endif %}

### Quality Assurance Standards

#### **Plan Viability Validation**
- **Execution Probability**: High likelihood of success based on failure analysis
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal use of available computational and time resources
- **Complexity Management**: Appropriate task granularity for current system state
- **Objective Achievement**: Clear path to successful goal completion

#### **Dependency Logic Excellence**
- **Valid References**: All dependencies point to existing task IDs
- **Acyclic Structure**: No circular dependencies or self-references
- **Logical Prerequisites**: Dependencies represent genuine blocking relationships
- **Parallel Opportunities**: Minimize unnecessary sequential constraints

#### **Resilience Enhancement**
- **Failure Isolation**: Problems in one task don't cascade to others
- **Alternative Paths**: Multiple ways to achieve critical objectives
- **Graceful Degradation**: Plan can succeed even with individual task failures
- **Recovery Compatibility**: Works well with retry and recovery mechanisms

## Adaptive Replanning Execution

### Modification Process (4-Phase Approach)

#### **PHASE 1: Failure/Feedback Analysis**
1. **Analyze Root Causes**: {% if failed_children %}Understand why {{ failed_children|length }} children failed{% elif failure_reason %}Process recovery reason: {{ failure_reason }}{% else %}Parse human feedback requirements{% endif %}
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify systematic issues vs. isolated problems
3. **Context Integration**: Use error details, retry history, and system state
4. **Success Preservation**: Identify what worked well and should be maintained

#### **PHASE 2: Strategic Replanning**
1. **Modification Strategy**: Choose appropriate replanning approach based on analysis
2. **Task Reconfiguration**: Redesign failed approaches with better success probability
3. **Dependency Optimization**: Enhance parallel execution and reduce failure propagation
4. **Resilience Building**: Add robustness against similar future failures

#### **PHASE 3: Plan Reconstruction**
1. **Task Definition**: Create new tasks with clear, achievable goals
2. **Type Optimization**: Select task types with highest success probability
3. **Dependency Design**: Build logical, minimal dependency structures
4. **Effort Estimation**: Realistic estimates based on failure learning

#### **PHASE 4: Validation and Enhancement**
1. **Objective Verification**: Ensure plan still achieves original goal
2. **Resilience Check**: Validate robustness against known failure modes
3. **Execution Optimization**: Maximize parallel opportunities and efficiency
4. **Quality Assurance**: Confirm each task is well-defined and executable

### Modification Guidelines by Scenario

#### **For Recovery-Driven Replanning**:
{% if failed_children %}

- **Consider task type changes** based on failure analysis
{% endif %}

#### **For Human Feedback Integration**:
- **Implement requests precisely** while maintaining plan coherence
- **Optimize beyond minimum** to deliver superior results
- **Preserve successful elements** not targeted by feedback
- **Validate feasibility** of requested changes within constraints

#### **For System Recovery Scenarios**:
{% if failure_reason %}
- **Address recovery context**: {{ failure_reason }}
- **Reduce system stress** through simpler, more reliable approaches
- **Leverage proven patterns** that have higher success rates
- **Build circuit breaker compatibility** for stressed systems
{% endif %}
