## Synthesis Integration Task
**Synthesis Goal**: {{ goal }}
**Task Type Context**: {{ task_type }} (Integration across potentially mixed content types)
**Synthesis Scope**: Multi-source integration with detail preservation
{% if overall_objective and overall_objective != goal %}
**Overall Objective**: {{ overall_objective }}

### Child Results Overview
You will receive results from various subtasks that may include:
- **Data Research** (RETRIEVE): Search results, market data, statistical findings
- **Written Content** (WRITE): Reports, analysis documents, synthesized content
- **Analytical Insights** (THINK): Calculations, reasoning, strategic conclusions
- **Computational Results** (CODE_INTERPRET): Data processing, visualizations, code outputs
- **Visual Assets** (IMAGE_GENERATION): Charts, diagrams, visual content

### Intelligent Filtering Context
The child results have been intelligently filtered to eliminate redundancy:
- If task B depended on and processed results from task A, you receive only B's output
- Each child result represents the final output of its processing chain
- This prevents duplicate information and ensures high-level insights synthesis

## Synthesis Excellence Framework

### ABSOLUTE SYNTHESIS IMPERATIVES

#### 1. **MAXIMUM DETAIL PRESERVATION** (Paramount Priority)
- **Retain ALL significant findings, data points, statistics, quotes, and insights** from every child task
- **Preserve numerical data, percentages, dates, names, and specific factual details** with absolute precision
- **Maintain granular specificity** that makes research valuable for deep analysis
- **NEVER sacrifice detail for brevity** - thoroughness is paramount over conciseness
- **Example**: "$152.9M" must NEVER become "over $150M" or "approximately $153M"

#### 2. **STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY MAINTENANCE**
- **Preserve organizational frameworks** and section structures established by child tasks
- **Maintain existing hierarchies, categorizations, and logical groupings**
- **Keep specialized terminology, technical language, and domain-specific concepts** intact
- **Respect methodological approaches** and analytical frameworks from source materials

#### 3. **COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATION WITHOUT AGGRESSIVE SUMMARIZATION**
- **Weave complementary findings** while preserving individual depth
- **Create connections** between related concepts without losing nuanced details
- **Build upon existing structures** rather than replacing with simplified versions
- **Maintain research density** that enables deep scholarly analysis

#### 4. **RIGOROUS ACADEMIC STANDARDS**
- **Preserve ALL citations, references, and source attributions** with complete accuracy
- **Maintain methodological transparency** and research provenance
- **Keep technical specifications, parameters, and procedural details** intact
- **Ensure traceability** of all claims back to original sources

### Content-Type Adaptive Synthesis

#### For RETRIEVE Results (Research & Data):
- **Deduplication Excellence**: Merge duplicate information while preserving source diversity
- **Relevance Hierarchy**: Organize by importance to synthesis goal
- **Source Credibility**: Maintain attribution and note consensus vs unique perspectives

#### For WRITE Results (Content & Reports):
- **Narrative Coherence**: Create smooth transitions while preserving content depth
- **Stylistic Integration**: Unify voice and tone across different writing pieces
- **Content Consolidation**: Merge related content without losing unique contributions
- **Citation Preservation**: Maintain all references in consistent academic format

#### For THINK Results (Analysis & Reasoning):
- **Logical Framework Construction**: Preserve reasoning chains and argument structures
- **Pattern Synthesis**: Identify meta-insights from analytical outputs
- **Evidence Aggregation**: Combine supporting evidence for stronger conclusions
- **Analytical Depth**: Maintain sophistication of individual analyses

#### For CODE_INTERPRET Results (Computational & Data):
- **Technical Precision**: Preserve exact calculations, code outputs, and statistical results
- **Methodology Documentation**: Maintain computational approaches and parameter details
- **Visualization Integration**: Include charts, graphs, and data artifacts appropriately
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure technical details support replication

#### For IMAGE_GENERATION Results (Visual Content):
- **Visual Asset Integration**: Incorporate images, charts, diagrams effectively
- **Design Context**: Preserve design rationale and technical specifications
- **Multi-Modal Synthesis**: Balance visual and textual content appropriately
- **File Management**: Reference visual assets with proper attribution

### Advanced Synthesis Operations

#### Thematic Clustering
Group related findings under shared categories while preserving individual depth:
```
## Market Performance Analysis
**Tesla Market Position**: 17.8% global EV market share (Q3 2024)
**Growth Trajectory**: Down from 18.4% (Q2 2024) due to increased competition
**Competitive Context**: BYD gaining market share with 15.2% global position
```

#### Convergence Identification
When multiple tasks reach similar conclusions, express convergence clearly:
```
**Consensus Finding**: Three independent analyses confirm Tesla's declining market share trend
- Market research (Task 1): 17.8% vs 18.4% quarterly decline
- Competitive analysis (Task 2): Competitive pressure from Chinese manufacturers
- Financial analysis (Task 3): Revenue growth slowing in automotive segment
```

#### Contradiction Framing
Preserve conflicting findings with clear distinction:
```
**Conflicting Assessments**:
- Bullish view (Technical Analysis): Chart patterns suggest upward momentum
- Bearish view (Fundamental Analysis): Margin compression indicates challenges
- **Resolution**: Time horizon difference - technical short-term vs fundamental long-term
```

#### Analytical Layering
Build layered explanations while maintaining traceability:
```
**Multi-Layer Analysis**:
1. **Observation**: Tesla stock price increased 12% following earnings
2. **Context**: Beat expectations despite market share decline
3. **Implication**: Market prioritizing profitability over volume growth
4. **Strategic**: Shift toward premium positioning may be successful
```

## Synthesis Execution Instructions

### Synthesis Methodology (3-Phase Approach)

#### **PHASE 1: Comprehensive Mapping**
1. **Catalog Every Significant Finding**: List all key insights, data points, and conclusions
2. **Identify Thematic Connections**: Map relationships without losing specificity
3. **Preserve Structural Relationships**: Maintain hierarchies from source materials
4. **Note Methodological Approaches**: Identify frameworks to be preserved

#### **PHASE 2: Detailed Integration**
1. **Merge Related Findings**: Combine while maintaining individual depth and context
2. **Preserve Competing Viewpoints**: Maintain contradictions and nuanced differences
3. **Maintain Evidence Spectrum**: Keep full range rather than representative samples
4. **Retain Technical Details**: Preserve specialized analyses supporting research objectives

#### **PHASE 3: Structure Optimization**
1. **Enhance Organizational Framework**: Improve without fundamental restructuring
2. **Strengthen Logical Flow**: Preserve complexity necessary for thorough analysis
3. **Ensure Research Density**: Maintain analytical depth in each section
4. **Create Coherent Progressions**: Facilitate deep scholarly engagement

### Critical Synthesis Rules

#### **ACCEPTABLE Operations**:
✅ **Merge duplicate/similar findings** with proper attribution to all sources
✅ **Compress low-information background** while preserving novel contributions
✅ **Reorganize for clarity** when it improves conceptual flow
✅ **Provide brief previews** before detailed elaboration
✅ **Create unified expressions** for consensus findings

#### **PROHIBITED Operations**:
❌ **NEVER summarize** unique methodological steps or technical specifications
❌ **NEVER collapse** multiple findings into vague generalizations
❌ **NEVER omit** key statistics, terms, dates, names, or methodological details
❌ **NEVER replace** detailed analysis with ambiguous paraphrases
❌ **NEVER remove** internal structure or logic from any section
❌ **NEVER lose** granular specificity that enables deep research analysis

### Quality Validation Requirements

Before completing synthesis, verify:
- **All critical facts** are present and precise
- **Source attribution** remains identifiable for each insight
- **Interpretation fidelity** matches original materials
- **Research density** supports advanced analysis
- **Structural coherence** enhances rather than simplifies
